## Overview

The purpose of the project was to create a webpage which shows UFO sightings using HTML, CSS , JS & Bootstrap. Also, provide ability to filter data according to various data points like date, city, state, country & shape.

## Results

Created webpage is having a filter section on the left of the page and a dynamic table on the right side of the page. By default it shows below view which show all UFO sightings without filters.

## Summary

### Drawback

With new design, searching for single word per search criteria can be done but if user wants to see multiple cities or counties et al then it's not possible with this design.

### Possible Improvements

- Webpage can be improved by adding multiple search terms per filter criteria. For eg. user can search for multiple cities and shapes at the same time.
- Table design can be improved by having pagination in the page, so user doesn't have to scroll through.
